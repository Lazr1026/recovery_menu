# PLEASE READ!

Honestly I didn't want to write this because of the brick risks involved. You have to edit many system files which when done wrong can lead to devastating consequences.

If you are not that experienced with Wii U Homebrew, do not follow this. It's not as easy as region changing, say the 3DS.

That being said, be careful and have a NAND Backup just in case.

Oh, and after region changing, you will need a gamepad from that region (unless you use Aroma, which has that region-free gamepad pairing plugin)

## What you need:
- A Brain, a large one at that.
- A way to run [UDPIH](https://github.com/GaryOderNichts/udpih) to be able to run the recovery_menu. You *might* be able to do this without it but dont take your chances.
- A modified [recovery_menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lazr1026/regionchange/main/files/recovery_menu). ([Source](https://github.com/Lazr1026/recovery_menu))
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [wupclient.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Elpunical/mocha/master/ios_mcp/wupclient.py) (right-click -> Save link asâ€¦ -> Click Save)
- A text editor. Notepad will be fine

You may notice I didn't mention Tiramisu or Aroma. That is because it will interfere with this. You can still have it installed and follow this but it doesnt matter at the end of the day.

## Region Changing
1. Format your console. Yes this is required. I'll explain why later (scroll down).
1. Pair a gamepad and get to the point where you set up a network in the Initial Setup, then shut down.
1. Load the recovery_menu with UDPIH.
1. Start wupserver in the recovery_menu.
1. Open the command line/terminal where you saved `wupclient.py`
1. Windows: `py -3 -i wupclient.py` macOS/Linux: `python3 -i wupclient.py`
1. Input your IP when asked,
1. Insert`w.dl("/vol/system/config/sys_prod.xml")` into the CLI.
1. Open `sys_prod.xml` in a text editor.
	- Replace the `produce_area` value with the desired region. 1 = JPN, 2 = USA, 4 = EUR. Also replace the `game_region` value with `119` (RegionHax).
	- Make sure you save your changes!
1. Insert `w.up("sys_prod.xml", (/vol/system/config/sys_prod.xml")` into the CLI
1. Exit wupclient with `exit()`
1. Press a button on the wiiu to shut down wupserver and go to `Set Coldboot Title`.
1. Set the System Settings for your region as the default title.
1. Reboot.
1. Start a System Update. It should start to "Update".
1. Wait for the update to finish. When its done you should be taken to the desired regions Wii U Menu.
1. Complete initial setup.
	- You will see duplicate titles. This is normal as the titles from the original region are still installed.
	
## Removing old titles
!> VERY easy way to brick if you arent paying attention.
1. Start FTP (one that lets you access system files).
1. Navigate to `storage_mlc01/sys/title/`
1. Click to view a list of titles to delete.
